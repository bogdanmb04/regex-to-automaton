Formal Languages & Automata Theory project. This program builds an DFA based on an input regex, accepting the language defined by the respective regex. It gives the user th following menu options in CLI:
  1. View the input regex (in a more humane way)
  2. Display the automata - using a transition table
  3. Check if a word is accepted by the DFA
  4. Exit the application

There are some elements of Modern C++ included within the project - such as lambda functions, unpacking, usage of `std::variant`, `std::format` as well as a visitor used for display purposes.
